# Styletools

## What is the Styletools ?

Styletools is a little framework I developped for my personnal needs.

This frameworks contains :
* prefabricated stylesheets (including responsive)
* MVC architecture (including routers and .htaccess file)
* HTML template
* webmanifest for progressive web app
* a demo

Originally, I outsourced CSS code of all my projects in one file.

## How does it works ?
